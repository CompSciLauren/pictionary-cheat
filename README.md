> GUI to cheat on online pictionary games

> PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To cheat on a pictionary game. In this game, a user is drawing an image on the screen. The other users playing must guess the word represented by the picture. Everyone knows how many words there are and how many characters per word. Over time, letters will start to be revealed on the screen. This program takes all known info about the word(s) and narrows down the possibilities for the user, based on previous words from the game. This was made for a particular pictionary game in the Minecraft server Mineplex.
